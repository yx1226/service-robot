# service-robot

This is my Final Year Project: service robot in receptionist of office.

I used Zenbo robot (product od ASUS Technology, Taiwan) for my project to investigate the ability of this service family robot. Then, the operating system of robot is a Android. Before starting the development, Zenbo SDK need to be downloaded from the ASUS developer.

The tasks will be done by robot:
- As a guide tour 
- Inform the executive if outsider request to meet with him/ her.
- Introduce the faculty by providing the QR code for outsider to scan and access our webpage.

For this project's main objective is to study the human-robot interaction via information counter service. Outsider and member of faculty will be encouraged to communicate with this robot to get the further information about school.
