# service-robot

This is my Final Year Project: service robot in receptionist of office
The tasks will be done by robot:
- As a guide tour 
- Inform the exercutive if outsider request to meet with her/him.
- Introduce the faculty by providing the QR code for outsider to scan and access our webpage.

For this project's main objective is to study the human-robot interaction via information counter service. Outsider and member of faculty will be encouraged to communicate with this robot to get the further information about school.
